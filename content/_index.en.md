# Welcome to happyDomain

---

happyDomain is a software that makes the domain names management easy and reduces the usual friction points, by offering a simpler interface and centralizing your domains.

We are an open source project: you can use the official interface available at [`www.happydomain.org`](https://www.happydomain.org/), or install it at home.
The source code is available on [framagit](https://framagit.org/happyDNS/): you can consult it, copy it, give your opinion, report bugs or make modifications, as you wish.
