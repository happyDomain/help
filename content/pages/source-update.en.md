You access this screen either:

- when you want to add a host, after having selected the provider,
- when you want to change the connection settings between happyDomain and a host, for example on the [home page]({{< relref "home#modify-or-delete-a-host" >}}).

## Connection name

In order to find you among the different hosts, the first field you are asked for is a name.
This name will only be used to allow you to easily identify the host of your domain, if you have several.


## Other fields

Each host needs different information to establish a connection with happyDomain.
Follow the instructions on each screen.
