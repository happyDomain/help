You reach this screen after having validated on [home page]({{% relref "home#add-a-domain" %}}) the form to add a domain (and you didn' previously [selected a host in the right filter]({{% relref "home#your-registries-and-domain-hosters" %}})).

## Hosting provider selection

You can see on this screen the different hosts you have already configured.
If your domain is part of one of the listed accounts, just click on it, it will be added automatically.

If you haven't added the host yet, you can do it now by following the link ["Add now!"]({{% relref "provider-new-choice" %}}).
